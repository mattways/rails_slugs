= Slugs

Inspired in friendly_id but more minimalistic.

= Install

Put this line in your Gemfile:
  gem 'slugs'
  
Then bundle:
  $ bundle
  
= Usage

Add the column in your migration:
  t.string :slug

(If you are using translatable_records you need to place the column in the translation table, this has been done this way because itâ€™s easier to maintain and your queries will be faster avoiding extra joins)  

Update your db:
  rake db:migrate

Call the has_slug method in your model:

If you want to use the value of one field:
  has_slug :prop
  
To concatenate the value of multiple fields:
  has_slug :prop1, :prop2, :prop3
  
Or if you need a very custom slug you can use a lambda, proc or block:
  has_slug proc { |record| "#{record.prop}-custom" }
