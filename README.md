# Slugs

Manages slugs for records with minimal efford in rails.

## Why

I did this gem to:

- Generalize how to control when routes will use the slug param.
- Keep old slugs active until the record is destroyed.
- Ensure unique slugs by appending an index automatically on duplicates.

## Install

Put this line in your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'slugs'
```

Then bundle:
```
$ bundle
```

## Configuration

Run the install generator:
```
$ bundle exec rails g slugs:install
```

Set the global settings:
```ruby
Slugs.configure do |config|
  config.use_slug? do |record, params|
    params[:controller] != 'admin'
  end
end
```

## Usage

### Definitions

Add the column to your tables:
```ruby
class AddSlug < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :products, :slug, :string
  end
end
```

Update your db:
```
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

Define slugs in your models:
```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_slug :model, :name, scope: :shop_id
end
```

### Migration

If you already have values in the slug column, you can migrate those with:
```ruby
$ bundle exec rake slugs:migrate
```

### Generation

A slug will be generated every time you create/update a record:
```ruby
product = Product.create(name: 'Stratocaster', model: 'American Standar', ...)
product.slug
# => 'american-standard-stratocaster'
```

An index will be appended if another record with the same slug is created:
```ruby
product = Product.create(name: 'Stratocaster', model: 'American Standard', ...)
product.slug
# => 'american-standard-stratocaster-1'
```

Every time you change a record, the slug will be updated:
```ruby
product.update name: 'Strat'
product.slug
# => 'american-standard-strat'
```

### Finders

The find method of models will start accepting slugs and remember old ones:
```ruby
Product.find 'american-standard-stratocaster'
# => product

Product.find 'american-standard-strat'
# => product
```

### Routes

The logic of the use_slug? block is used to determine when to sluggize:
```ruby
admin_product_path product
# => 'admin/products/34443'

product_path product
# => 'products/american-standard-strat'
```

## Contributing

Any issue, pull request, comment of any kind is more than welcome!

I will mainly ensure compatibility to Rails, AWS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch and FreeBSD.Â
